<p>Few people write specifications for their software these days. The
reason for this clear: there are few benefits from doing so, especially
when taking into account the risk of the specification and the real
system drifting out of sync (i.e. either the system or the specification
is changed, but we forget to update the other).</p>
<p>Spex tries to address this shortcoming of specifications by in
addition to being a specification language, it's also a verifier that
checks if some system respects the specification -- thereby always
ensuring that the two are in sync.</p>
<p>In the process of testing the real system against the specification
is will also produce minimal test cases for potential problems it
notices along the way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Non-2xx responses;</li>
<li>JSON response decoding and type issues;</li>
<li>Non-reachable APIs.</li>
</ul>
<p>(We'll look at examples of how exactly this gets reported in the next
section on features.)</p>
<p>In the future we'd like to derive more useful functionality from
specifications, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to import and export OpenAPI/Swagger, Protobuf, etc. Think
of how Pandoc can covert between text formats, perhaps we can do the
same between specifications;</li>
<li>Generate a prototype implementation from a specification, so that
you can demo your idea or hand of a working server HTTP API to the
frontend team before the actual backend is done (without risking that
there will be a mismatch in the end, since the real backend is tested
against the same specification as the prototype is derived from);</li>
<li>A REPL, which allows you to explore a system using a specification.
Tab completion is provided for the API and random payload data is
generated on the fly;</li>
<li>A time traveling debugger which enables you to step forwards and
backwards through a sequence of API calls, in order to explore how the
system evolves over time.</li>
<li>Lua templating (again similar to Pandoc) which enables code
generation from specifications or the minimal test cases that the
verifer produces;</li>
<li>The ability to refine types, e.g.
<code>{ petId : Int | petId &gt; 0 }</code> and be able to generate
validation logic from these;</li>
<li>Generate diagrams for a better overview of how components are
connected.</li>
</ul>
<p>With this future functionality we hope to get to the point where
there's a clear benefit to writing specifications!</p>
