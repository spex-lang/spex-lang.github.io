<h1 id="the-motivation-behind-spex">The motivation behind Spex</h1>
<p><em>Work in progress</em></p>
<p>Whenever a new (programming) language is proposed, the first question
that comes to most peoples' minds is: do we really need yet another
language?</p>
<p>In order to properly answer this question and thus motivate why we
need <em>Spex</em>, we need to first cover what a <em>specification
language</em> is, how they are different from programming languages, and
what they are useful for.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-specification-language">What is a "specification
language"?</h2>
<p>In a lecture, back in 2010, Joe Armstrong <a
href="https://youtu.be/ieEaaofM7uU?list=PL_aCdZH3eJJVki0YqHbJtqZKSmcbXH0jP&amp;t=68">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We need languages to describe encodings and protocols not machine
instructions"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then went on to elaborate saying that we have plenty (too many)
programming languages (e.g. C, Java, Go, Python, Erlang, etc) which at a
high-level allow us to manipulate machines via machine instructions (and
syscalls). However we only have a few <em>specification languages</em>
which describe encodings and protocols, i.e. describe what's going on
<em>between</em> two, or more, machines!</p>
<p>In a later <a href="https://youtu.be/ed7A7r6DBsM?t=723">talk</a>
(2013) Joe has the following slide:</p>
<p><img src="asset/joe_protocols.png"
alt="Joe Armstrong&#39;s talk &quot;The How and Why of Fitting Things Together&quot;" /></p>
<p>Where the black boxes are written using programming languages while
the big red arrow between is what Joe means with encodings and
protocols. It's this big red arrow which is what we need different
languages for, and to distinguish them from "normal" programming
languages, we shall call them specification languages.</p>
<p><em>Spex</em> tries to be such a specification language.</p>
<h2 id="the-difference-between-apis-encoding-and-protocols">The
difference between APIs, encoding and protocols</h2>
<p>Before we can start talking about the shortcomings of current
specification languages, it's helpful to first break down Joe's red
arrow. It actually has three components:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The interface of the blackbox (the API), i.e. what messages the
component accepts;</li>
<li>The encoding of the messages, i.e. what bytes (or bits) are sent
over the communication channel;</li>
<li>The protocol, i.e. what sequences of messages are allowed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hopefully it's clear what encodings are (e.g. UTF-8 encoded JSON or
binary Protobuf messages), but it might be worth pondering the
difference between APIs and protocols.</p>
<p>In the latter of the above mentioned talks, Joe gives an example
where merely knowing the API isn't good enough. The example he gives is
the POSIX filesystem API:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>open</code>: takes a filepath and returns a file
descriptor;</li>
<li><code>write</code>: takes a file descriptor and string and returns
how many bytes it successfully wrote;</li>
<li><code>close</code>: takes a file descriptor and closes it, thus
freeing up resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nothing in the API says, for example, that we can't continue writing
to a file descriptor that has been closed! This is where protocols come
in, saying for example that we can only write to a file descritor that
is open, etc.</p>
<p>One last point to note is that APIs can be synchronous or
asynchronous, as in the client of the API gets a response back
immediately upon making the call or it (potentially) gets the response
sometime in the future.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-problems-with-past-approaches">What are the
problems with past approaches?</h2>
<p>Now that we've established the differences between APIs, encodings
and protocols, we can start talking about where the current
specification languages fall short.</p>
<h3 id="choose-two-out-of-three">Choose two out of three</h3>
<p>The first thing to note is that very few specification languages
support specifying all three aspects. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>OpenAPI specifications: describe synchronous APIs, the encoding can
affected by the content-type, e.g. <code>application/json</code>,
<code>application/xml</code> or
<code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>, but there's no way to
specify protocols;</li>
<li>Protobuf: only specifies message encodings. Together with gRPC it
can be used to specify APIs also, but it cannot be used to specify
protocols;</li>
<li>JSON schema: can be used to disallow JSON messages that don't
conform to some schema, but again say something about which sequences of
messages are allowed.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other side of the fence, we have things like <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_type">session types</a>
which support specifications of APIs and protocols, but don't talk about
encodings.</p>
<p>There's one exception which supports specifying all three aspects and
that's Joe's <a
href="https://erlang.org/workshop/2002/Armstrong.pdf">Universal Binary
Format</a> (2002), it seems to have been largely forgotten about
though.</p>
<ul>
<li>Syntax for specifing sync and async APIs?
<ul>
<li>gRPC can do this, but again only for gRPC systems...</li>
<li><a
href="https://www.asyncapi.com/en">https://www.asyncapi.com/en</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="syntax-and-tooling">Syntax and tooling</h3>
<p>In addition to the aspets of what you can specify, it's also
important to consider how pleasant it's to read and write such
specifications and what you can do with them -- i.e. what tooling is
available once we have a specification.</p>
<p>Ultimately the low use of specification languages must at least
somewhat be a reflection of the fact that specifications are not worth
the effort?</p>
<p>A key factor in this equation is the risk of the specification and
the system being specified getting out of sync, i.e. either the
specification changes and the corresponding change isn't done in the
system or vice versa, which significantly devalues the specification
effort.</p>
<p>There are two strategies that existing solutions use:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Test for conformity between the specification and the system;</li>
<li>Generate code from the specification, thus ensuring correctness by
construction.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, OpenAPI specifications can be used as basis for testing
using third-party tooling, while gRPC with Protobuf takes the latter
approach.</p>
<p>There's an obvious advantage in the correct-by-construction approach
in that no testing is needed, but there's also a less obvious downside:
it doesn't make sense to use Protobuf to specify an already existing
(legacy) system.</p>
<p>Why would one want to specify an existing system? There could be many
reasons:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>To document the system and have tooling which generates
documentation from the specification;</li>
<li>To use the specification as a blueprint for a rewrite, i.e. specify
the old system, test it the specification agains the old system to
ensure it's correct, then use the specification to develop the new
system, potentially generating code from the specification, and finally
testing the new system against the specification to ensure that it
behaves like the old system;</li>
<li>To increase the test coverage of the system by deriving tests from
the specification;</li>
<li>To derive a mock from the specification which can be used in
contract tests.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ok that was a lot about tooling, let's just finish off on a lighter
note by talking about syntax.</p>
<p>OpenAPI specifications are written in JSON or YAML, which verbose and
hard to read. Just like the world is slowly realsing that these formats
are bad for configuration, due to not being well-specified and lacking
abstraction abilities, it seems that slowly people are realising that
for the same reasons JSON or YAML are also bad specification
languages.</p>
<p>Earlier this year (2024) Microsoft released their specification
language <a href="https://typespec.io/">TypeSpec</a>, which introduces a
sane syntax inspired by TypeScript. It seems that they didn't release
any tooling on their own and instead seem to rely on translating into
OpenAPI specifications and using their tooling.</p>
<h3 id="property-based-testing">Property-based testing</h3>
<p>We've talked about specification languages and using tooling to test
that the system they intend to specify indeed behaves according to the
specification.</p>
<p>At this point it's also worth mentioning the relationship to
property-based testing.</p>
<p>When property-based testing is used to do blackbox testing of a
stateful API, then the property is a specification. Given that every
programming language has its own slightly different implementation
property-based testing, this means that we have (at least) one
specification language per programming language.</p>
<p>Since these property-based specifications are basically eDSLs
(embedded domain-specific language) which change when the libraries
change, the tooling for such specifications is almost non-existant
(except for the testing of a specification against a system).</p>
<p>Furthermore these eDSL specifications will have the idiosyncrasies of
their host-languages, making them hard to read and write by people who
don't know the host-language (or programming more generally).</p>
<h2 id="what-the-spex-specification-language-tries-to-do-different">What
the Spex specification language tries to do different</h2>
<p>Let's split this section into short and long term plans. The short
term plans are either partially implemented already, or there's a clear
idea how to implement them. The longer term plans on the other hand are
a bit more open ended.</p>
<h3 id="short-term">Short term</h3>
<p>Given our above analysis, there are a couple of obvious things that
we'd like to have in <em>Spex</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A sane syntax with good error messages;</li>
<li>A versatile toolkit, containing at least:
<ul>
<li>A verifier, which can test that some system respects some
specification;</li>
<li>Generate a prototype implementation from a specification, so that
you can demo your idea or hand of a working server HTTP API to the
frontend team before the actual backend is done (without risking that
there will be a mismatch in the end, since the real backend is tested
against the same specification as the prototype is derived from);</li>
<li>Ability to import and export OpenAPI/Swagger, Protobuf, etc. Think
of how Pandoc can covert between text formats, perhaps we can do the
same between specifications;</li>
<li>Lua templating (again similar to Pandoc) which enables code
generation from specifications or the minimal test cases that the
verifer produces.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>This would bring <em>Spex</em> on par with existing solutions,
especially considering one can always export to OpenAPI and use their
tooling as a fallback option.</p>
<p>However, as we already hinted at above, we can addition fix some
shortcomings by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allowing for more complete specifications, than OpenAPI, by having
syntax for both synchronous and asynchronous APIs;</li>
<li>Adding syntax for specifying protocols, i.e. valid sequences of API
calls, thereby addressing Joe's critisism;</li>
<li>A contract checker, i.e. a component/proxy which sits between two
component and checks that they follow the protocol at run-time, again
inspired by Joe's work.</li>
</ul>
<p>By being a language rather than merely a specification format, it
make sense to also provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>A REPL, which allows you to explore a system using a specification.
Tab completion is provided for the API and random payload data is
generated on the fly;</li>
<li>A time traveling debugger which enables you to step forwards and
backwards through a sequence of API calls, in order to explore how the
system evolves over time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Taking a language rather than format centric approach also makes it
easier to provide unified tooling that coevolves with the syntax,
e.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li>Refinement types -- validation logic;</li>
<li>Model definitions -- fakes rather than mocks and better
fuzzing;</li>
<li>BNF syntax for describing context-free grammars -- and generators
that can use this to generate structured data;</li>
<li>Literate Spex -- to make it easier to embed specifiations and the
output that can be produced from them straight into documentation
itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's hard to imagine what trying to add these things to e.g. OpenAPI
even would look like, given that it doesn't have it's own syntax.</p>
<p>With this future functionality we hope to get to the point where
there's a clear benefit to writing specifications!</p>
<h3 id="long-term">Long term</h3>
<p>Given how few specification languages there are, as Joe pointed out,
there's plenty of design choices to be made. Longer term it would be
interesting to explore some of this design space.</p>
<p>Here are some ideas of possible syntax and tooling extensions:</p>
<ul>
<li>OpenAPI and Protobuf describe the interface of one machine, but what
about the topology? I.e. which machine talks to which machine? These
more complete system specifications open up the potential for other
kinds of tooling:
<ul>
<li>Linters that ensures global consistancy;</li>
<li>More complete documentation with diagrams for visualising how
components are connected;</li>
<li>Generation of deployment related code;</li>
<li>Load testing.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We can also imagine being able to specify human-to-machine
interfaces, such as CLIs and GUIs, in addition to the machine-to-machine
APIs that we've already discussed;</li>
<li>Can we partially solve the problem of all property-based
specifications in different programming languages all have different
formats and no shared tooling?</li>
<li>Protobuf is an example of an interface description language (IDL),
it lets you define interfaces using predefined types that Protobuf
provides a predefined way of serialising those types into binary which
can be sent over the network or saved to disk. What if we wanted to
specify our own binary format? Perhaps we want to use some compression
method that is particular to our problem domain. Allowing specification
of binary formats in general would be interesting to look at;</li>
<li>Ultimately it would be interesting to try to specify Spex in Spex
itself. It would be difficult to make this a completely formal
specification that can't drift apart from the implementation, but it
would be interesting to see how far one can get.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Hopefully by now the following should be clear:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>What specification languages are and how they are different from
programming languages;</li>
<li>That existing specification languages leave a lot to be
desired;</li>
<li>How Spex is trying to fix the current pain points.</li>
